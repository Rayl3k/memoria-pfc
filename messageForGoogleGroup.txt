Hi everyone,

The other day I got granted a limited access to production on my web application. I've been playing a little bit with the data and I'm trying to figure out why I see some differences on the search results performed by my application (through the Javascript SDK) and the accessible data through familysearch.org

For example, if I launch a search for the surname smith (non exact matches)

On my web app through the javascript SDK:
- Query: https://familysearch.org/platform/tree/search?q=surname%3Asmith~&start=0&access_token=...
- Number of returned results through the getResultsCount() function of the Javascript SDK: 4.881.867

On the Familysearch website:
- Query: https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&query=%2Bsurname%3Asmith~
- Number of returned results: 48.983.848

Another example, looking for registers that match the condition: Birthplace = United States

On my web app:
- Query: search?q=birthPlace%3A%22United%20States%22&start=0&access_token=...
- Number of returned results: 168.387

On the Familysearch website:
- Query: /results?count=20&query=%2Bbirth_place%3A%22United%20States%22
- Number of returned results: 91.7065.543

What am I missing here? Any help would be much appreciated.
